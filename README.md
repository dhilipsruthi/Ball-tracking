# Ball-tracking
The ability to track an object is of huge importance for various areas such as the military, commercial applications, monitoring, sports, and robotics. In the sports area, especially in ball-based sports, there have been various approaches to try to track the ball for various purposes, mainly for obtaining multidimensional data, or decision making during games. In the case of the game of pool,has described some advantages regarding ball tracking such as the ball color and the small region that the pool table represents, and some disadvantages such as the small ball size and the varying velocities of the balls. In this work, we are going to track multiple billiard balls being hit over a pool table. We will track their movements during a period of the game and overlay a line representing their movement.
